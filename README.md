## 💡 Problem Statement
The current placement process at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad is burdened by manual work and the limitations of external platforms like **Superset**, leading to inefficiencies:
- **Time-consuming manual tasks** for SCPT members.
- **Costly subscription fees** for third-party services.
- **Lack of flexibility** in adapting to our specific needs.

With no centralized portal for companies, much of the placement process is handled via **email**, leading to redundant work and missed opportunities. This project addresses these inefficiencies and provides a more streamlined, secure, and flexible solution.
